# Decision Tree Classification Using PySpark
This project demonstrates how to use PySpark's MLlib to implement a Decision Tree Classifier. The code includes data preprocessing steps to convert categorical data into numerical formats, which is required for MLlib models, and it runs within a Spark environment.

**Project Overview**
The goal of this project is to classify data using a Decision Tree algorithm implemented in PySpark's MLlib library. It uses labeled data, where each record contains both features and a target label, to train and evaluate the model.

**Features of the Code:**
1. Environment Setup: Configures and initializes a Spark environment.
2. Data Preprocessing: Converts raw CSV data into numerical features.
3. Decision Tree Training: Uses Spark MLlib's DecisionTree module to build and train the model.
